The program counting the number of posters needed to cover a given area of buildings.

The program is a solution to a computer science olympiad task.
Its purpose was to calculate the optimal number of posters needed to cover the entire front of buildings, based on user input of building parameters and their quantities.
Assumptions made in the program:

1. There are no gaps between buildings.
2. All buildings are aligned in a single line and have the shape of perfect rectangles, which means the posters also have only 2 dimensions.
